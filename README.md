## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
This project involves business queries to analyze retail sales data. The dataset contains information about 
sales transactions, customer details, product categories, and other relevant metrics. The queries aim to provide 
insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

### SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:


    - Retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05 :
    - Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022 :
    - Calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category :
    - Find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category :
    - Find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000 :
    - Find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category :
    - Calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year :
    - Find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales :
    - Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category :
    - Create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17) :


## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different
                             categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Project Insights

The queries help answer key business questions such as:

 - Identifying sales trends by date, category, and customer behavior.
 - Calculating total sales and average metrics.
 - Analyzing customer demographics and preferences.
 - Determining peak sales hours and customer engagement.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory 
data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding 
sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
